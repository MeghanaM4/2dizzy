# 2dizzy
A 2-player tilting platformer game that messes with your head. Player 1 controls the tilt of the world with a tilt switch attached to their hand (or with the "K" key if you're not using a gamepad) and makes the character jump by putting their hand close to the ultrasonic sensor. Player 2 can move the character backwards and forwards with the joystick.
